  about:
    as_housing_price_in_many_areas: As housing prices in many areas continue to rise, co-owning can make homeownership a lot more affordable as the mortgage will be shared between co-owners. With many of us adding roommates, moving back in with family, or hoping for more rent control, it is becoming difficult to save up for one or multiple homes. Co-owning provides many financial benefits to help you increase your buying power, improve credit score, and make consistent monthly payments that go directly towards your home investment.
    at_cher_we_hope: "At Cher, we hope to make your road to co-ownership as simple as possible. The co-ownership process at Cher is broken down into 6 steps: complete profile, flag homes, add co-owners, get pre-qualified, find a real estate agent, and escrow chat. You can see which step you are currently at by looking at the checklist on your dashboard."
    cher_as_partnered_up: Cher has partnered up with UWM and Quicken Wholesale Loans, two of the largest wholesale lenders in the country. These lenders offer competitive mortgages to our clients. Interest rates on loans are as low as 3%. Furthermore, Cher charges no closing costs, which can save users up to $10,000 and as low as 3% down payment that is shared between co-owners.
    cher_is_an_all_in_one: Cher is an all-in-one platform that is designed to make the entire co-ownership process simple and secure for all aspiring homeowners. It allows user to find their dream home, add desired co-owners, obtain competitive loans, and connect with real estate professionals.
